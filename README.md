### 3 conclusions that can be drawn from the crowd funding campaigns are,
## Conclusion 1: Goal outcomes
•	When the funding goal is between 15,000 to 35,000 probability of a successful campaign goes up
•	As funding goal increases, tipping point of goal being 40,000, probability of an adverse outcome (successful proportions starting to decline/ failed proportions beginning to increase) goes up.
Conclusion 2: Performance of Parent Category
•	Top 3 Parent categories with highest successful proportions compared to all outcomes are,
o	Journalism 100% success rate
o	Technology 67% success rate
o	Photography 62% success rate

Conclusion 3: Performance of Sub Category
•	Plays leads the pack of sub categories (34%)
•	However that does not equate to higher success rate (successful: 54% failed: 38%)
•	On the other hand sub categories of audio and world music have 100% success rate with 0% failure rate, however number of submissions are lowest 4 and 3 respectively

Limitations of data set
Seasonality prediction: is difficult as more data needs to be presented to determine if goal outcomes are determined by month of the year.
Fund analyses: Goal and pledged funds are in different currencies, therefore deriving conclusions with regards to funding quantum and outcomes can be erroneous. Common currency denomination needs to be specified.
Correlation of parent and sub category with outcomes: As the blurb for the same category can be varied, definitive conclusion on success rate for a specific parent or sub category cannot be made. The blurb could be a variable that determine soutcome.

Other tables that can be created
Country analysis: We can compare trends within a country for parent/ sub category and compare with trends in other countries to determine commonality.
Backer analysis: We can compare backer behaviour by country in terms of projects funded and amounts pledged.
Statistical analysis
Data set is not symmetrical. Variation between mean and media for successful and failed outcomes is high.
Therefore median is better in this instance to capture how the data behaves
